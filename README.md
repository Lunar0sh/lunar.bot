# So you wanna Self-Host a APOD Bot?
Well.. here you go!

Welcome to the Lunar.bot APOD project. This is a robust, caching, and media-compressing Discord bot that brings the cosmos directly to your servers and DMs using the official NASA API. 

## Features
* **Smart Local Caching:** Prevents hammering the NASA API. The bot downloads and caches the daily drop locally to save bandwidth and rate limits.
* **Built-in Media Compression:** Automatically compresses large files (like high-res images or massive MP4s) using `ffmpeg` and `Pillow` to fit within Discord's strict 24MB upload limit.
* **User App Support:** Configured to be installed directly to a user's Discord profile, allowing the `/apod` command to be used in any DM or server.
* **Graceful Fallbacks:** If a file is absolutely too large even after aggressive compression (or hosted externally like YouTube), the bot safely falls back to providing direct source URLs without crashing.
* **Automated Cleanup:** Keeps your host storage clean by automatically deleting cache files older than 7 days.
* **Multi-Message Rendering:** Splitting text embeds and native video files to ensure Discord renders the layout perfectly every time.

## Prerequisites
Before you start, make sure your host machine has the following installed:
* **Python 3.11+**
* **FFmpeg:** Required for the heavy video compression. 
  * Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt update && sudo apt install ffmpeg`
  * Arch Linux: `sudo pacman -S ffmpeg`
* A **Discord Bot Token** (Obtained from the Discord Developer Portal)
* A **NASA API Key** (Obtained for free at api.nasa.gov)

## Installation

1. **Prepare your environment:**
   Ensure `bot.py` and `requirements.txt` are in your project directory.

2. **Install Python dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure your environment variables:**
   Create a file named `.env` in the root directory and add your keys:
   ```env
   DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token_here
   NASA_API_KEY=your_nasa_api_key_here
   ```

4. **Run the bot:**
   ```bash
   python bot.py
   ```
   *Note: The bot will automatically generate the `config.json`, `cache.json`, and the `cached/` directory on its first run.*

## Available Commands

### Public Commands
* `/apod` - Fetches the current Astronomy Picture of the Day.
* `/random` - Pulls a random APOD from the NASA archives.

### Admin & Owner Commands
* `/apod_setup` - (Requires Manage Channels) Sets the current channel for the automated daily 8:00 AM (Europe/Berlin) drop.
* `/status` - (Owner only) Displays ping, CPU/RAM usage, and local cache size.
* `/nuke` - (Owner only) Wipes all old command trees across all connected servers. Ideal for cleaning up ghost commands from previous bot iterations.

## Important Developer Notes
* **Privileged Intents:** Because this bot uses 100% Slash Commands, you do **not** need the Privileged Message Content Intent enabled in the Developer Portal. This bypasses Discord's 100-server verification lock.
* **Dev Server Hardcoding:** The `/nuke` command is registered exclusively to a Developer Server to bypass rate limits. Make sure to update the `DEV_GUILD_ID` and `OWNER_ID` variables at the top of `bot.py` to match your Discord IDs.
* **User App Installation:** To allow users to install this bot directly to their profiles, ensure you enable "User Install" in the Discord Developer Portal under the "Installation" tab.
